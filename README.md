Hello from NanoSpaziale!

Below you will find my solutions for the Bandit challenges from the site overthewire.org

***
In this guide, you wonâ€™t find the best solution or the most performant easy-to-code solution for the level; instead, you should expect something made by someone (me) who is still learning all this stuff. Enjoy!

# Bandit level 0
Level 0 is not a proper level; instead, we should consider it an introduction to understanding how to connect to a server online through an SSH tunnel.

As we can see in the image above, we can use the man page for a command to understand its functionality and all the various options that the command can provide us.
Of course, we can use any search engine to explore videos and tutorials on how to use something 
>Note: The man page explore every functionality of a command, but in most cases it is not the best to understanding how a command works
