Hello from NanoSpaziale!

Below you will find my solutions for the Bandit challenges from the site overthewire.org

What is Bandit?
I believe that if you're here, you already know what Bandit is and how it works. However, Bandit is a free wargame from the site [Over the wire](overthewire.org/wargames/bandit) that can help you develop hacking skills and a basic understanding of Linux.
