Hello from NanoSpaziale!

Here you will find my solutions for the wargames available at [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).

***
**In this guide, you wonâ€™t find the best solution or the most performant, easy-to-code solution for the level; instead, you should expect something made by someone (me) who is still learning all this stuff. Enjoy!**
***
This page is work in progress. Every time i manage to solve a level, i will post a guide to the level on this page.

I will follow the order suggested by OTW
