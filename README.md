Hello from NanoSpaziale!

Below you will find my solutions for the Bandit challenges from the site overthewire.org

What is Bandit?
I believe that if you're here, you already know what Bandit is and how it works. However, Bandit is a free wargame from the site [Over the wire](overthewire.org/wargames/bandit) that can help you develop hacking skills and a basic understanding of Linux.

**In this guide, you wonâ€™t find the best solution or the most performant, easy-to-code solution for the level; instead, you should expect something made by someone (me) who is still learning all this stuff. Enjoy!**

# bandit_level0->1

This level tells us that the password is located in the home directory inside a file called "readme." By typing the command `ls`, we can print a list of files stored in the current directory. 
>The `pwd` command (Print Working Directory) can help us find out where we are.

Now we can print directly the content of the file, but if we want to be sure that the file listed a moment ago is a readable file, we can check with the command `file`

As we can see, the command `file` helps us determine the file type. Since the file type is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) we can print to the screen it's content.
There is a bunch of commans that we can use for print the content of a file, here are some:

`cat` it's the most common command to print the content of a file.

`tail` print the last 10 lines of a file.

`head`, do the opposite of `tail` by printing the first 10 lines of the file.

`more` is an interactive command to explore the file. It will go in interactive mode, only if the screen size is not enough to print its content. Instead, if the screen size it is enough, it print and quit.

`less` is a better version of `more`, because it enter interactive mode, regardless of whether the screen size is sufficient.

As we can see, there are a bunch of methods to see the content of a file!  
Now we have the password for level 2.

***
# bandit_level1->2
***
In this level, the password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.

Now that we are connected we can type `ls`

Now we need to open the **-** file present here.
