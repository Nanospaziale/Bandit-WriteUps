Hello from NanoSpaziale!

Here you will find my solutions for the wargames available at [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).

***
**In this guide, you won’t find the best solution or the most performant, easy-to-code solution for the level; instead, you should expect something made by someone (me) who is still learning all this stuff. Enjoy!**
***
This page is work in progress. Every time i manage to solve a level, i will post a guide to the level on this page.

I will follow the order suggested by OTW

>Tips
>Don’t rely excessively on ChatGPT or any other LLMs; instead, try to use your own brain to find a personal solution. Besides being more fulfilling, this will help you develop your skills and your thinking.
>Every now and then, the OverTheWire staff change the passwords for all levels, so remember to take note of them and save them!
