As stated in the level description, our goal is to find the password inside the only human-readable file. Note that the description says human-readable, not merely readable: this suggests the file is plain text (for example, ASCII) that can be read directly by a person, rather than a binary file that would require conversion from machine format to a human-readable form.  

Let's start by typing `ls` to see that we have a folder to explore:

Once inside the folder, typing `ls` again shows that we have multiple files to analyze  
(**Note** that these filenames start with a dash [**See Level 2**](https://github.com/Nanospaziale/OTW-WriteUps/blob/main/bandit/level02.md)).    

Let’s start by using `file`, a command that helps us determine what type a file is.

So, with `file`, we can use the command `file ./-*`.

  <summary>Here's the explanation of the command I used above:  </summary>
  
  - `file` - Simply the command
  - `./` - This is one of the method that we can use to open dashed file (Used also in level 2)
  - `-*` -  Explicitly tells `file` to open all files whose names start with a dash `-`, regardless of what comes after.
  >In simple terms, the `*` symbol is a wildcard used in the shell to represent “anything.”
  >That means it can stand for any number of characters in a filename or path. For example, `file*` matches `file1`, `file2`, or `fileX`.
  >So when we write `-*`, we’re telling the command to include all files whose names begin with a dash, no matter what follows.
</details>

At this point, we can see that the only readable file among the others is -file07 (ASCII text).

There it is — we’ve found the password for the next level!
