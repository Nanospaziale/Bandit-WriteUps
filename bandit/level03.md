This level asks us to find the password in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory.  
Now, once connected we can print the content of the current directory by typing `ls`

We can see a file named `--spaces in this filename--` that begins with two hyphens, so we need to handle it the same way we handled the file in the previous level.
