In this level, the password is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.  

Now that we are connected we can type `ls`

Now we need to open the **-** file present in the home directory.  
As well as the previous level, there are a bunch of methods to open this file, but first let's analyze and understand what a dashed file is.  
A dashed file is one that starts its name with a **'-'** 

In this case, the only file present here in the directory is **-**.  

If we try to open it with most of the utilities used in the previous level, the screen will be hung because the standard [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) treats the **"-"** as standard input. Thus, most commands consider this file as Standard Input (StdIn) and not as a regular file.

To use these commands and let them treat **"-"** like a file and not a StdIn, we need to use **./** or the **/full/path/to/the/file**.  
Let's try:

To see the full path of the file, we can use the command `pwd` in the directory where the file is

So the final command will be

Here we go, we have our password!!

***
**Note**  
In the previous level, I did not use the command `more`. In fact, if you use this command with the dashed file, you will notice that more prints the content of the file directly and does not treat - as standard input (StdIn).

Why?  
The explanation comes from the command's history.  
If we do some digging, we can see that `more -` treats **“-”** as a literal filename, not as stdin, so it tries to open a file named **“-”** and, if it doesn’t exist, just reads stdin by fallback and prints it immediately.
On the other hand, `less -` or any other commands quoted above , explicitly interprets **“-”** as standard input, waiting for data to arrive before displaying anything.
