This level tells us that the password is the only line that appears once in the file **data.txt**.  
After confirming the file’s presence with `ls`, we can start working on it.

Here we go.  
First, we need to run `file` to see what kind of file it is. It turns out to be an ASCII text file, so we can go ahead and check how many lines it has.

Using the `wc -l` command, we can see that the file has 1001 lines, too many to check one by one.

At this point, we can concatenate various command to get our password:  
With command `cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u` we can retrieve easily our password from the file ***data.txt***.

  <summary> Why use sort? </summary>
  
> Since I'm a curious person, I always try to understand *why* a command works the way it does.  
> In this particular case, why do I need to use `sort | uniq -u` instead of just `uniq -u`?  
> If I try `cat data.txt | uniq -u`, I get a completely different result from the one obtained with `sort`. But why?

> 
> According to the manual, the `-u` option should print only the lines that occur once.  
> But how does it actually determine whether a line appears only once?  
> After doing some research, I found that `uniq -u` does not print lines that occur only once globally, but lines that occur once **consecutively**. What does that mean?

>
> As you can see in the image above, if I try to print 3 words and pipe `echo` into `uniq -u`, the result is not what I expected.  
> This command prints the words that repeat **consecutively**, not the ones that occur only once.  
> Instead, using `sort` before `uniq -u` returns the words that actually occur only once.
> So, `uniq -u` only considers consecutive lines. If a line appears multiple times non-consecutively, it’s treated as unique relative to the previous line.

That's it, we got our password!
