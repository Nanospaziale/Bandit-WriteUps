Following the description above, we can see that our password is stored inside a hidden file in the directory `inhere`.  
  
Once logged in, we can easily find the folder mentioned in the description by typing `ls`.

We can dive into this folder, but unfortunately, there won't be any files — or at least, that’s how it looks at first.

In fact, as stated in the level’s description, the file we’re looking for is hidden.  

By browsing through the man page of `ls`, we can find some interesting options.  

`-a`

Bingo!  
Using `ls -a` our file will be shown and we can use our typical command to open it.

Using `cat`, but we can use also the other commands from the previous level.

> TIPS: While using `ls`, I recommend using these options: `-a` (to show all content), `-l` (to display the output in long list format), and `-h` (to show file sizes in a human-readable format).  
> The first two options (`-l` and `-a`) can also be used by running the command `ll` (on most modern filesystems).
