This level is very similar to the previous one, except for the proprerties of the file we are searching for.    
- Owned by user bandit7  
- Owned by group bandit6  
- 33 bytes in size  

If we try to do `ls` we can see that there are no files or directories.  
Indeed, as stated in the description of the level, we have to search for the file in the entire server.
