In this level we have to search the password in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.

`ls` will print to the screen our file *data.txt*.  

Before outputting the content, let's inspect the file size and line count. This can help us to know if we can simply cat the file or not (If inside *data.txt* there are 10 lines we can check it manually).
To do so, we can use `wc -l filename`. This will print to the screen the line count of data.txt.

Or we can use `nl filename`, however, the difference from the previous command is that `nl` also prints the line content along with its line number.

We can agree that 98567 lines are a bit too much to be read one by one. (However, if you are a patient person, you can read one by one!!)  
At this point, we need to tell to the pc that we want only the line that contains the word *millionth*.  
  
`grep` comes in handy with this type of problem. In fact, this command filters lines that match a given pattern.  
  
We can pipe `grep` to every single command that prints the content of a file to the screen, e.g. `more`, `less`.  
Be careful when using `head` and `tail`, as the command might fail to find the word *millionth* if itâ€™s not within the first or last 10 lines of the code.  
Of course, you need to pass the option -n to `tail` or `head` or they will check only the first and last 10 lines of the file.  

Let's see some commands then:  

- cat

> The command `grep` is case sensitive, so be aware of what you type in the command!! However there are various options for this command, like `-i`
